# Basel Tools

`Basel Tools` is a set of `GUI` applications that can produce a rough estimation of capital requirements based on the `Basel IV` regulatory framework. The following applications are currently available:
* `BaselCCR`: a tool for calculating the capital requirements related to the counterparty credit risk exposures (SA-CCR, BCBS 279).
* `BaselOP`: a tool for calculating the capital requirements related to the operational risk exposures (SMA, BCBS 356).

## Requirements

The minimum Matlab version required is `R2017a`. In addition, the following products and toolboxes must be installed in order to properly execute the script:
* Computer Vision System Toolbox
* Curve Fitting Toolbox
* MATLAB Distributed Computing Server
* Optimization Toolbox
* Parallel Computing Toolbox
* Simulink Control Design
* Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
* System Identification Toolbox'
